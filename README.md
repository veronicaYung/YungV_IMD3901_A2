Overview of what you did (i.e. what are the controls? Why this design?)

For this assignmnet, the user can move around in the barn house and spawn, delete and pickup packages. 
On desktop, users can move around with wasd/arrow controls and look around with their mouse. To adapt this movement 
with mobile users, I added a joystick feature. I chose to add the joystick instead of buttons because the UI was going to
take up to  much space while users are walking with the package.
